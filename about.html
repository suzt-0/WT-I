                I have till this date have done about 2 projects and currently in the process of completing a 3rd one.
                It was made as my college project as well as my first project ever.
                It was made with C programming language and the name of the project was <strong>"Test Taking
                    System"</strong>. My 2nd Project <strong>"Project Management System"</strong> was an utter failure.
                It has a major data security issue which was reaveled as we were performing our demo.
                Also the server decided to crash on the fated day of our project demo. So, overall the project demo
                decided that the project was made with poor design and couldn't connect to the database due to server
                failure.
                Ironically, the server started working as if nothing had happened the very next day. <br><br> So, That's about it
                about me if you wish to know more about me, contact me or just give feedback about my projects
                contact me through social media or
                any other form that I have provided in this site.
